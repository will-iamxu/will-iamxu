## About Me

I‚Äôm most motivated when I get to work on systems that interface directly with the physical world. That‚Äôs why I dove into underwater robotics research, where I developed sonar-based mapping tools and robust control systems in ROS2. My journey blends hands-on hardware work with software engineering, from building real-time sensor suites to deploying ML models that drive smarter systems.

- üî¨**Underwater Robotics Researcher:** Built sonar-based SLAM and control systems for BlueREV, an autonomous underwater robot.
-  **Data-Driven Problem Solver:** Optimized user engagement at Palos Verdes Pulse with ML-powered article curation (120% increase in engagement).
-  **Peer Tutor:** Helped fellow Aggies master Python and problem-solving in ENGR 102.
-  **NSF Research Intern:** Led field trials, boosted deployment success, and improved robot vision with advanced sensor fusion.

## Featured Projects

### EV Bettor
*Automated sports betting system for positive expected value bets.*  
Python + Selenium + MySQL  
- Scraped odds from multiple sportsbooks, analyzed implied probabilities, and placed real/simulated bets when EV was positive.
- Maintained robust scraping logic despite frequent changes in site structures.
- Used SciPy for statistical processing and simulation.

### BlueREV Underwater Robot (Aggie Autonomous Robotics Research Group)
- Developed sonar suite and SLAM-based localization with Gaussian regression.
- Built ROS2 nodes in C++/Python, containerized with Docker for Jetson deployment.
- Reduced navigation errors by 200% and improved real-world deployment success by 25%.
