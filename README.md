## 🚀 About Me

I’m most motivated when I get to work on systems that interface directly with the physical world. That’s why I dove into underwater robotics research, where I developed sonar-based mapping tools and robust control systems in ROS2. My journey blends hands-on hardware work with software engineering, from building real-time sensor suites to deploying ML models that drive smarter systems.

- 🔬 **Underwater Robotics Researcher:** Built sonar-based SLAM and control systems for BlueREV, an autonomous underwater robot.
- 🎯 **Data-Driven Problem Solver:** Optimized user engagement at Palos Verdes Pulse with ML-powered article curation (120% increase in engagement).
- 🤝 **Peer Tutor:** Helped fellow Aggies master Python and problem-solving in ENGR 102.
- 🧑‍🔬 **NSF Research Intern:** Led field trials, boosted deployment success, and improved robot vision with advanced sensor fusion.
- 🛠️ **Builder @ Heart:** From web apps to microcontrollers, I enjoy tackling projects that make a tangible impact.
